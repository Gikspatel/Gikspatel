    <h2>1.Lion</h2>
    <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/6q3PdtKb/1-Lion.jpg" height="300px" width="400px" title="This is a lion" alt="Error 404" srcset="">
    <p> <details> <summary> The Lion </summary> The Lion(Panthera leo) is a large cat of the genus Panthera native to Africa and India. It has a muscular, broad-chested body, short, rounded head, round ears, and a hairy tuft at the end of its tail. It is sexually dimorphic; adult male lions are larger than females and have a prominent mane. It is a social species, forming groups called prides. A lion's pride consists of a few adult males, related females, and cubs. Groups of female lions usually hunt together, preying mostly on large ungulates. The lion is an apex and keystone predator; although some lions scavenge when opportunities occur and have been known to hunt humans, the species typically does not actively seek out and prey on humans.</details></p>

    <h2>2.Leopard</h2>
    <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/65zZW4Rc/2-Leopard.jpg" height="300px" width="400px" title="This is a Leopard" alt="Error 404" srcset="">
    <p> <details> <summary> The Leopard </summary> The leopard (Panthera pardus) is one of the five extant species in the genus Panthera, a member of the cat family, Felidae.It occurs in a wide range in sub-Saharan Africa, in some parts of Western and Central Asia, Southern Russia, and on the Indian subcontinent to Southeast and East Asia. It is listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List because leopard populations are threatened by habitat loss and fragmentation, and are declining in large parts of the global range. The leopard is considered locally extinct in Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea, Jordan, Morocco, Togo, the United Arab Emirates, Uzbekistan, Lebanon, Mauritania, Kuwait, Syria, Libya, Tunisia and most likely in North Korea, Gambia, Laos, Lesotho, Tajikistan, Vietnam and Israel.Contemporary records suggest that the leopard occurs in only 25% of its historical global range.</details></p>

    <h2>3.Deer</h2>
    <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/zv7yG4Lv/3-Deer.jpg" height="300px" width="400px" title="This is a Deer" alt="Error 404" srcset="">
    <p> <details> <summary> The Deer </summary> Deer or true deer are hoofed ruminant mammals forming the family Cervidae. The two main groups of deer are the Cervinae, including the muntjac, the elk (wapiti), the red deer, and the fallow deer; and the Capreolinae, including the reindeer (caribou), white-tailed deer, the roe deer, and the moose. Male deer of all species (except the water deer), as well as female reindeer, grow and shed new antlers each year. In this they differ from permanently horned antelope, which are part of a different family (Bovidae) within the same order of even-toed ungulates</details></p>

    <h2>4.Tiger</h2>
    <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/GpTTxMfg/4-Tiger.jpg" height="300px" width="400px" title="This is a Tiger" alt="Error 404" srcset="">
    <p> <details> <summary> The Tiger </summary>The Tiger (Panthera tigris) is the largest living cat species and a member of the genus Panthera. It is most recognisable for its dark vertical stripes on orange fur with a white underside. An apex predator, it primarily preys on ungulates, such as deer and wild boar. It is territorial and generally a solitary but social predator, requiring large contiguous areas of habitat to support its requirements for prey and rearing of its offspring. Tiger cubs stay with their mother for about two years and then become independent, leaving their mother's home range to establish their own. </details></p>

    <h2>5.Camel</h2>
    <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/SxsMJQfh/6-Cemal.jpg" height="300px" width="400px" title="This is a Camel" alt="Error 404" srcset="">
    <p> <details> <summary> The Camel </summary>A Camel is an even-toed ungulate in the genus Camelus that bears distinctive fatty deposits known as "humps" on its back. Camels have long been domesticated and, as livestock, they provide food (milk and meat) and textiles (fiber and felt from hair). Camels are working animals especially suited to their desert habitat and are a vital means of transport for passengers and cargo. There are three surviving species of camel. The one-humped dromedary makes up 94% of the world's camel population, and the two-humped Bactrian camel makes up 6%. The Wild Bactrian camel is a separate species and is now critically endangered. </details></p>

    <h2>6.Dog</h2>
    <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/mDQc0PBQ/7-Dog.jpg" height="300px" width="400px" title="This is a Dog" alt="Error 404" srcset="">
    <p> <details> <summary> The Dog </summary>The dog is a domesticated descendant of the wolf. Also called the domestic dog, it is derived from the extinct Pleistocene wolf, and the modern wolf is the dog's nearest living relative. Dogs were the first species to be domesticated by hunter-gatherers over 15,000 years ago before the development of agriculture.Due to their long association with humans, dogs have expanded to a large number of domestic individuals and gained the ability to thrive on a starch-rich diet that would be inadequate for other canids</details></p>

    <h2>7.Elephant</h2>
    <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/2y05DvJB/8-Elephant.jpg" height="300px" width="400px" title="This is a Elephant" alt="Error 404" srcset="">
    <p> <details> <summary> The Elephant </summary>Elephants are the largest existing land animals. Three living species are currently recognised: the African bush elephant, the African forest elephant, and the Asian elephant. They are the only surviving members of the family Elephantidae and the order Proboscidea. The order was formerly much more diverse during the Pleistocene, but most species became extinct during the Late Pleistocene epoch. Distinctive features of elephants include a long proboscis called a trunk, tusks, large ear flaps, pillar-like legs, and tough but sensitive skin. The trunk is used for breathing, bringing food and water to the mouth, and grasping objects. Tusks, which are derived from the incisor teeth, serve both as weapons and as tools for moving objects and digging. The large ear flaps assist in maintaining a constant body temperature as well as in communication. African elephants have larger ears and concave backs, whereas Asian elephants have smaller ears, and convex or level backs.</details></p>

    <h2>8.Cat</h2>
    <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/sDnBddd0/9-Cat-1.jpg" height="300px" width="400px" title="This is a Cat" alt="Error 404" srcset="">
    <p> <details> <summary> The Cat </summary>he cat (Felis catus) is a domestic species of small carnivorous mammal. It is the only domesticated species in the family Felidae and is commonly referred to as the domestic cat or house cat to distinguish it from the wild members of the family. Cats are commonly kept as house pets but can also be farm cats or feral cats; the feral cat ranges freely and avoids human contact.[5] Domestic cats are valued by humans for companionship and their ability to kill rodents. About 60 cat breeds are recognized by various cat registries.

     The cat is similar in anatomy to the other felid species: it has a strong flexible body, quick reflexes, sharp teeth, and retractable claws adapted to killing small prey. Its night vision and sense of smell are well developed. Cat communication includes vocalizations like meowing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling, and grunting as well as cat-specific body language. Although the cat is a social species, it is a solitary hunter. As a predator, it is crepuscular, i.e. most active at dawn and dusk. It can hear sounds too faint or too high in frequency for human ears, such as those made by mice and other small mammals.It also secretes and perceives pheromones.</details></p>

    <h2>9.Cow</h2>
    <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/9QrDc8cX/10-Cow.jpg" height="300px" width="400px" title="This is a Cow" alt="Error 404" srcset="">
    <p> <details> <summary> The Cow </summary>Constitution of India mandates the protection of cows in India.The slaughter of cattle is allowed with restrictions (like a 'fit-for-slaughter' certificate which may be issued depending on factors like age and gender of cattle, continued economic viability, etc.), but only for bulls and buffaloes and not cows in fourteen states. It is completely banned in six states with pending litigation in the supreme court to overturn the ban, while there is no restriction in many states.

    Gopastami, a holiday celebrated by the Hindus once a year, is one of the few instances where cows receive prayers in modern-day India.[81] While the cow is still respected and honored by most of the Indian population, there has been controversy over the treatment of the cows during the holiday.</details></p>

    <h2>10.Zebra</h2>
    <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/dVpL3202/11-zebra-1.jpg" height="300px" width="400px" title="This is a Zebra" alt="Error 404" srcset="">
    <p> <details> <summary> The Zebra </summary>Zebras are African equines with distinctive black-and-white striped coats. There are three living species: the Grévy's zebra (Equus grevyi), plains zebra (E. quagga), and the mountain zebra (E. zebra). Zebras share the genus Equus with horses and asses, the three groups being the only living members of the family Equidae. Zebra stripes come in different patterns, unique to each individual. Several theories have been proposed for the function of these stripes, with most evidence supporting them as a deterrent for biting flies. Zebras inhabit eastern and southern Africa and can be found in a variety of habitats such as savannahs, grasslands, woodlands, shrublands, and mountainous areas.</details></p>

    <h2>11.Monkey</h2>
    <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/2yk5MTHD/12-Monky.jpg" height="300px" width="400px" title="This is a Monkey" alt="Error 404" srcset="">
    <p> <details> <summary> The Monkey </summary>Monkey is a common name that may refer to most mammals of the infraorder Simiiformes, also known as the simians. Traditionally, all animals in the group now known as simians are counted as monkeys except the apes, which constitutes an incomplete paraphyletic grouping; however, in the broader sense based on cladistics, apes (Hominoidea) are also included, making the terms monkeys and simians synonyms in regards to their scope.</details></p>

    <h2>12.Fox</h2>
    <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/Bnrn4JhN/13-Fox.jpg" height="300px" width="400px" title="This is a Fox" alt="Error 404" srcset="">
    <p> <details> <summary> The Fox </summary>Fox live on every continent except Antarctica. The most common and widespread species of fox is the red fox (Vulpes vulpes) with about 47 recognized subspecies.The global distribution of foxes, together with their widespread reputation for cunning, has contributed to their prominence in popular culture and folklore in many societies around the world. The hunting of foxes with packs of hounds, long an established pursuit in Europe, especially in the British Isles, was exported by European settlers to various parts of the New World.</details></p>

    <h2>13.Bear</h2>
    <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/wx2ML8vT/14-Bear.jpg" height="300px" width="400px" title="This is a Bear" alt="Error 404" srcset="">
    <p> <details> <summary> The Bear </summary>Bears have been hunted since prehistoric times for their meat and fur; they have been used for bear-baiting and other forms of entertainment, such as being made to dance. With their powerful physical presence, they play a prominent role in the arts, mythology, and other cultural aspects of various human societies. In modern times, bears have come under pressure through encroachment on their habitats and illegal trade in bear parts, including the Asian bile bear market. The IUCN lists six bear species as vulnerable or endangered, and even least concern species, such as the brown bear, are at risk of extirpation in certain countries. The poaching and international trade of these most threatened populations are prohibited, but still ongoing.</details></p>

    <h2>14.Giraffe</h2>
    <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/fbYTb1ps/15-Giraffe.jpg" height="300px" width="400px" title="This is a Giraffe" alt="Error 404" srcset="">
    <p> <details> <summary> The Giraffe </summary>The Giraffe is a large African hoofed mammal belonging to the genus Giraffa. It is the tallest living terrestrial animal and the largest ruminant on Earth. Traditionally, giraffes were thought to be one species, Giraffa camelopardalis, with nine subspecies. Most recently, researchers proposed dividing them into up to eight extant species due to new research into their mitochondrial and nuclear DNA, as well as morphological measurements. Seven other extinct species of Giraffa are known from the fossil record.</details></p>

    <h2>15.Rabbit</h2>
    <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/fbYTb1ps/15-Giraffe.jpg" height="300px" width="400px" title="This is a Rabbit" alt="Error 404" srcset="">
    <p> <details> <summary> The Rabbit </summary>Rabbits, also known as bunnies or bunny rabbits, are small mammals in the family Leporidae (which also contains the hares) of the order Lagomorpha (which also contains the pikas). Oryctolagus cuniculus includes the European rabbit species and its descendants, the world's 305 breeds[1] of domestic rabbit. Sylvilagus includes 13 wild rabbit species, among them the seven types of cottontail. The European rabbit, which has been introduced on every continent except Antarctica, is familiar throughout the world as a wild prey animal and as a domesticated form of livestock and pet. With its widespread effect on ecologies and cultures, the rabbit is, in many areas of the world, a part of daily life—as food, clothing, a companion, and a source of artistic inspiration.</details></p>
